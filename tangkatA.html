tangkat shehu yakzem
my experience thus far has been wonderful
i have gain alot this passed few days with code plateau 
the NHUB instructors are so resourceful
i have being schooled about the wrong notion i was having before this training commence
now i can tentatively say i am a certified novice programmer
i have so much to learn
believe with determination, no obstacle can hinder one in his or her quest.
looking forward to conquering the world through programming
